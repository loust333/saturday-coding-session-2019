# Coding Session 2019

## 9/11 - Environment, HTML

Presentation: [HTML Presentation](powerpoint/HTML.pdf)

### 1. Environment

### Editor

We need an application to code, to help us find the problems with the different syntaxes and to simplify our life.

- https://code.visualstudio.com/ (Works for Windows, Mac, Linux)

User guide:

- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery (Extensions)

### Browser

We need to visualize the result of our coding.

If we want to code and have fun, we only need one browser
If we want to code, have FUN and make it visible to the world, we need all browsers available online and all versions

Problem: The users visit a web site and they don't use the same browser with the same version.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers 

Is it worth it to adapt web site to each web browser? **NO**

You lose too much ~~time~~ **money**, it starts to be unproductive!

Minimal requirements:

- Mozilla Firefox (verify if it is updated to the most recent version)
- Google Chrome (verify if it is updated to the most recent version)

We have now an editor application and a browser application installed.

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
